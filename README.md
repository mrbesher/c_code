# ytucode 1. year
This repository contains some projects that I wrote / am writing for university assignments. Folders are named after their relative courses. There are a huge room for improvments and there are a lot of things that I know now and didn't when I wrote those. I don't plan on doing anything with these projects anyway, so I am making them open for fun.

## Tetris
A simole implementation of the popular TETRIS game lacking a lot of functionality. It works best on unix-like operating systems.

## Numerical Methods
Those are assignments to reinvent some calculation methods. Beware of memory leaks. It's everywhere in my code in its current state.

## Histogram equalization
A simple code for small file inputs (photos in pgm format) to apply histogram equalization to them. Note that the code will work only if the header comments are removed.
